# terraform-aws-lambda-layer [![Build Status](https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda-layer/workflows/Terraform%20Lint/badge.svg)](https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda-layer/actions) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda-layer.svg)](https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda-layer/releases/latest) [![Semantic Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)


Terraform module designed to facilitate the creation of AWS Lambda layers.


---


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).





## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda-layer/releases).


### Simple Example

```hcl
module "layer" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda-layer.git?ref=master"
  layer_name   = "dependencies"
  package_file = "../Pipfile"
}
```

### Advanced Example

```hcl
module "layer" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda-layer.git?ref=master"
  layer_name   = "dependencies"
  source_dir   = "../src/lib"
  source_type  = "python"

  rsync_pattern = [
    "--exclude='**tests**'"
    "--exclude="'**__pycache__**'"
    "--include=module/{a,b,c}/"
    "--include='*.py'"
    "--exclude='module/*'"
  ]
}
```
